# gsd-designer

The purpose of this app is to aid researchers in the design of group sequential designs (GSD) with small sample sizes, featuring either t-tests or one-way ANOVA's.
While it was specifically developped for preclinical research, it can be used for any GSD with a small sample size as long as the conditions for the t-test respectively one-way ANOVA are met.
