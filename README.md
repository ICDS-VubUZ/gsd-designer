# gsd-designer

The purpose of this app is to aid researchers in the design of group sequential designs (GSD) with small sample sizes, featuring either t-tests or one-way ANOVA's. While the app was specifically developped for preclinical research, it can be used in any context for GSDs with small sample sizes as long as the conditions for the t-test respectively 
one-way ANOVA are met.

A tutorial of a basic example can be found in this github folder with the name 'S2_tutorial'. Extensions of this example featuring different forms of data loss are covered in 'S3_Handling data loss'. A brief description of mathematical techniques currently available for setting up GSDs with small sample sizes can be found in 'S1_Determining the critical values'. The technique used in this app is simulation, which is the last technique discussed in the document.
